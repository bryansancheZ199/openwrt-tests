# OpenWrt Testing

> With great many support devices comes great many tests

OpenWrt Testing is a framework to run tests on OpenWrt devices, emulated or
real. Using [`labgrid`](https://labgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to control
the devices, the framework offers a simple way to write tests and run them on
different hardware.

## Requirements

- An OpenWrt firmware image
- Python and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- QEMU


## Setup

For maximum convenience, clone the repository inside the `openwrt.git`
repository as `tests/`:

```shell
cd /path/to/openwrt.git/
git clone https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests.git tests/
```

Install required packages to use Labgrid and QEMU:

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install \
    qemu-system-mips \
    qemu-system-x86 \
    qemu-system-aarch64 \
    make \
    uv \
uv pip install pytest-reportportal
```

Verify the installation by running the tests:

```shell
make tests/setup V=s
```

## Running tests

You can run tests via the Makefile or directly using `pytest`.

### Using the Makefile

You can start runtime and shell tests via the Makefile.

#### Runtime tests

```shell
cd /path/to/openwrt.git
make tests/x86-64 V=s
```

### Standalone usage

If you don't plan to clone this repository inside the `openwrt.git` repository,
you can still run the tests. Use this command to run tests on `malta/be` image:

```shell
pytest tests/ \
    --lg-env targets/qemu-malta-be.yaml \
    --lg-log \
    --log-cli-level=CONSOLE \
    --lg-colored-steps \
    --firmware ../../openwrt/bin/targets/malta/be/openwrt-malta-be-vmlinux-initramfs.elf \
    --reportportal \
    -rp-launch="name_of_test" \
```
After finishing you can review the results of the tests at: https://tests.aparcar.org/ui/#openwrt/launches/all
credentials: 
username: User
password: Openwrt.user1


## Writing tests

The framework uses `pytest` to execute commands and evaluate the output. Test
cases use the two _fixture_ `ssh_command` or `shell_command`. The object offers
the function `run(cmd)` and returns _stdout_, _stderr_ (SSH only) and the exit
code.

The example below runs `uname -a` and checks that the device is running
_GNU/Linux_

```python
def test_uname(shell_command):
    assert "GNU/Linux" in shell_command.run("uname -a")[0][0]
```

## Remote Access

With *labgrid*, you can remotely access devices. Key capabilities include
**power control**, **console**, and **SSH access**.

To enable remote access, you need SSH access with forwarding enabled on the host
exporting the device. For example, to reach the device `openwrt-one` located in
the lab `labgrid-aparcar`, you must have access to both the `labgrid-aparcar`
host and use the `global-coordinator` as a jump host:

```shell
global-coordinator -> labgrid-aparcar -> openwrt-one
```

You can request access to existing labs or contribute your own. To do this,
submit a pull request modifying the `labnet.yaml` file.

To access a remote device, configure the following environment variables.
Notably, `LG_PROXY` sets the proxy host (always the lab name):

```shell
export LG_IMAGE=~/firmware/openwrt-ath79-generic-tplink_tl-wdr3600-v1-initramfs-kernel.bin # Firmware to boot
export LG_PLACE=aparcar-tplink_tl-wdr3600-v1 # Target device, formatted as <lab>-<device>
export LG_PROXY=labgrid-aparcar # Proxy to use, typically the lab name
export LG_ENV=targets/tplink_tl-wdr3600-v1.yaml # Environment definition
```

To avoid interference from CI or other developers, lock the device before use:

```shell
uv run labgrid-client lock
```

Once locked, you can power-cycle the device and access its console:

```shell
uv run labgrid-client power cycle
uv run labgrid-client console
```

To bring the device into a specific state—such as booting your firmware defined
by `LG_IMAGE`—use a state definition:

```shell
uv run labgrid-client --state shell console
```

You can also run local tests directly on the remote device:

```shell
pytest tests/ --log-cli-level=CONSOLE
```

Lastly, unlock your device when you're done:

```shell
uv run labgrid-client unlock
```
